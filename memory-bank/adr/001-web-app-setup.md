# ADR 001: Web Application Setup

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need to initialize the web application for the Seafood Calculator project. This decision record outlines the technical choices and implementation approach.

## Decision
We will use:
- Next.js 14 with App Router for the web application framework
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for component library
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for git hooks

## Implementation Details
1. Project Structure:
```
apps/web/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── ui/          # shadcn components
│   │   └── features/    # feature-specific components
│   ├── lib/
│   │   ├── utils/
│   │   └── hooks/
│   └── types/
├── tests/
│   ├── unit/
│   └── integration/
└── public/
```

2. Development Workflow:
- Feature branches for development
- Pre-commit hooks for linting and testing
- Automated testing in CI pipeline
- Code review required for merges

3. Quality Standards:
- 80% test coverage minimum
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance monitoring
- Error boundaries implementation

## Consequences
### Positive
- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- Modern development experience
- Consistent code style
- High-quality component library
- Good testing practices

### Negative
- Learning curve for team members
- Initial setup overhead
- More rigorous development process

## Notes
- Regular updates needed for dependencies
- Documentation must be maintained
- Performance monitoring required
