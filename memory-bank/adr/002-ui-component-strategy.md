# ADR 002: UI Component Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need a consistent and maintainable approach to UI components for the Seafood Calculator. The components need to be accessible, performant, and easy to customize.

## Decision
We will use shadcn/ui as our base component library with the following structure:

1. Component Organization:
```
components/
├── ui/          # Base shadcn components
├── features/    # Feature-specific components
│   ├── calculator/
│   ├── pricing/
│   └── reports/
└── layouts/     # Layout components
```

2. Implementation Strategy:
- Use shadcn/ui CLI to add components as needed
- Maintain consistent theming through CSS variables
- Create compound components for complex features
- Implement strict prop typing
- Add error boundaries for component isolation

3. Component Standards:
- All components must be accessible (ARIA)
- Include loading and error states
- Support dark mode
- Include proper TypeScript types
- Follow atomic design principles

## Technical Details
1. Base Components:
   - Button
   - Input
   - Select
   - Card
   - Form elements
   - Dialog
   - Toast notifications

2. Feature Components:
   - Calculator form
   - Price display
   - Results table
   - Export options

3. Testing Approach:
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for features
   - Accessibility testing
   - Visual regression testing

## Consequences
### Positive
- Consistent design language
- High-quality, accessible components
- Reduced development time
- Type-safe components
- Easy theme customization

### Negative
- Learning curve for shadcn/ui
- Need to maintain component documentation
- Regular updates required

## Notes
- Document all component variants
- Create storybook documentation
- Maintain accessibility compliance
